##Flux Redistribution / Random Subset Selection (FR/RSS)

A Monte Carlo simulation approach to calculating the maximal
lag parameter with a corresponding uncertainty from two flux
time series with known measurement uncertainty estimates, which
can then be used to constrain physical models of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) structure in AGN reverberation mapping studies.

The specific procedure is described in detail by Brad Peterson 
[here](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March11/Peterson/peterson2.pdf).
